	Khonsu 2023 is a Shooter game with light puzzle elements. 
While cleaning your ship you discover an old device; the ship tells you its a GBplayer.
You learn that the planet 2023 has 5 game carts, so you decide to go to the planet and collect the carts. 

There are five zones, each containing fun enemies and unique environments.

The carts you can collect:

Murph Racing:
Murph has fun racing around. Play in two modes on two courses. 
(Murph is a Gameboy character from another game making a cameo :) )

LazerTag:
LazerTag sets you in an arcade and laser tag facility. There are arcade games you can play. 
The laser tag game lets you choose how many players you want to compete against and the length
of your games. 
 Arcade Games: 
Endless runner- jump over incoming baddies.
Endless Dungeon- explore an endless dungeon to collect rare treasure. 
Endless BoneChomp- collect pellets and avoid a bug chasing you. 

Hearts and Swords:
This game sets you as a gladiator who is forced to fight. Heavy on the story and combat. 

Tiny Metal Gears That Are Solid Not Liquid:
You are an undercover field agent tasked with destroying metal gears. This is a stealth shooter game. 



Art:
Elvies -various tiles
ProtoPixel-various tiles
PixelMech-various tiles
Mol-various tiles

For judging purpose , I made a lot of my own art (all the sprites), but I did use and modify a lot of tiles. 
Hard to say what mix it is but maybe like 70% mine 20% modded and 10% unmodded.
